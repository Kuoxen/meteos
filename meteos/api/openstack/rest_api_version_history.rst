REST API Version History
========================

This documents the changes made to the REST API with every
microversion change. The description for each version should be a
verbose one which has enough information to be suitable for use in
user documentation.

1.0
---
  The 1.0 Meteos API includes all v1 core APIs existing prior to
  the introduction of microversions.  The /v1 URL is used to call
  1.0 APIs, and microversions headers sent to this endpoint are
  ignored.
